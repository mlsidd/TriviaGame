## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a fun quiz that required the user to answer questions and supplied a score once the questions were all answered or the time was up.

## My Approach
I decided to use a romantic comedy theme since I love romantic comedies.  I used radio buttons so that the user had to select one of the multiple choice options.  I created an array of question objects for the multiple choice questions.  I used the setInterval method to give the user a time limit on the quiz.
